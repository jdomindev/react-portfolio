                                With my newly expanded skill set from a UPENN coding bootcamp, Iâ€™m ready to dive into the world of web development and continue my coding journey. My skills include knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as, experience building full stack MERN apps, working with RESTful APIs and mySQL.

                                My interests include playing guitar, skateboarding, and playing video games in my free time. I also enjoy being outdoors and going "herping" at my local and state parks when I have the chance.</p>
