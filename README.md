# Jose Dominguez React Portfolio
## Description
This is my react portfolio that I am using to house my projects, resume, and contact information for employers and anyone who wants to see what I'm up to.

- During this project I learned how to set up a react environment where I modularized my html into components that are conditionally rendered based on what page you are currently on.
- I was also able to add a separate js file that house all my project info and then map over that data to dynamically generate cards showcasing my various projects.
- Each of the created components has its own style sheet associated with it as well.
